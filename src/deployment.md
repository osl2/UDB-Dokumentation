# Deployment

u<sup>db</sup> is a web application.
It is made up from [frontend](./deployment/frontend.md),
and a [backend](./deployment/backend.md).
The frontend is a bunch of static files and a configuration
file served using a webserver.
The backend is a binary that needs to be run, exposing a RESTful API.
Both need to be deployed to a server.
